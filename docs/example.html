      <h1>Hey, I'm Jane!</h1>
      <p>I was diagnosed with chronic heart illness in 2013. It took me a while to come to terms with my illness, and the consequent lifestyle changes I would have to make to maintain my health.I live differently than I did before: I cut out foods that I loved (which was painful for me, as an amateur chef!), I had to find ways to exercise differently than before, and allow for regular doctor's visits to make sure I was on the right track.</p>
      <p>There's no recovery in heart disease; there's only coping with. However, this doesn't weigh me down. I have a wonderful support system from my husband and my two children. My husband sells his homemade salsa at local farmers' markets to fund my medication, and my kids also help me financially in any way they can. I attend weekly WomenHeart meetings at the local hospital in my town, and they've really helped me adapt, emotionally and physically, to this diagnosis. They were also the ones who introduced me to Collective! Thank you for listening to my story, and if you would like to donate, any help at all would be greatly appreciated.</p>
