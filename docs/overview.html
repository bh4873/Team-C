                    <p class="lead section-lead">
                        There is nothing more universal than health.
                        In January 2017, our team came together because we saw a space where growth could be nurtured. Working towards creating a unique product, we hope to better ourselves as engineers/product managers/content producers. Our aim is to exceed the expectations of customers and build a better health-focused product.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Products</h3>
                    <p class="lead section-lead">
                        The number of Health solutions has exploded in the last few years, with technology ranging from smartwatches to productivity apps. Within such a rapidly developing environment lies an opportunity to take desktop access to new places.  
                        The word “Health” indicates a variety of categories – Fitness, Nutrition and Wellbeing (spiritual, mental and emotional) just to name a few. There are more than 165,000 Health apps now available in the Apple iTunes and Android app store.
                     </p>    
                    <h3>Customers</h3>
                    <p class="lead section-lead">
                        For online and mobile technology, millennials lead the way. Now largest demographic in the U.S. as of 2016, they are expected to spend more than $200 billion annually starting in 2017. With such a wide range of experiences within this demographic, we have initially chosen to focus on two subsets:
                        <br>
                        1. University and College students
                        Between the ages of 18 and 24, this demographic is easily accessible but are already using many different apps. There is an immense opportunity to develop a unique idea. This group are in a period where they are adapting their lifestyle to fit a new environment. Fitness, Nutrition and Wellbeing are all being negotiated and the habits picked up can last a lifetime.
                        <br>
                        2. Young Professionals
                        Between the ages of 20 and 39, this demographic work in largely white-color industries and have received an associate degree. Described as both relatively affluent and open to early adoption for technology, this group is an attractive target audience.
