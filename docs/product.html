      <h3>What we do</h3>
      <p>We are building a google chrome browser extension that encourages users to round up their online purchases (on Amazon, GrubHub, Postmates, Forever 21) and then donates that amount to a woman with heart disease. Our model encourages repeat use in part because of the nature disease is chronic. The small amount of the donations encourages our contributors to give constantly. Part of our product is the personalized campaign that allows our recipients to share their story, manage their funds and be as transparent as possible with the procedure as possible.</p>

    <div class="faq--item">
      <h3>Why we do it</h3>
      <p>The first reason is that Heart disease is the biggest killer of women in the US. Medication is an unending, numerous and expensive. There are women who have to end their medication (which they need to be healthy) because they cannot afford their medication. At the same time there are spaces where fundraising and philanthropic are competitive - sororities, schools and girl scouts. We see a possible synergy between these two areas.</p>
